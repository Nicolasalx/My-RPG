# 2D RPG Game in C

This project is a 2D RPG developed in C as part of a first-year programming challenge. The goal of the project was to create a fully functional RPG game, applying everything learned throughout the year, from basic programming concepts to advanced features like particle systems and collision detection. The game includes combat, quests, NPCs, an inventory system, and an engaging universe for players to explore.
